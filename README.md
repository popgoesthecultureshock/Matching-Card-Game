### **_Description_**

In a world where drag is on the forefront of issues to be addressed by certain polititians, outreach and representation matter.
Drag is not evil. While some drag queens are not good... _you know who you are_... They still have the right to be who they are, just like any citizen.
This matching game honors the moving-to-mainstream art form that is drag, and just some of the queens that emerged from the 14 seasons of RuPauls Drag Race. Heard of it?

This is a memory matching card game that users can play to see some of their favorite queens, and compete with each other with their high scores, or low score: how few turns it takes them.
Chantay you stay through all three levels of 24, 30, and 36 cards in less turns than your friends, or sashay away.
Spread the joys drag can create sharing this child friendly game with your friends and family!
